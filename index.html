                        <h2>Some Background</h2>
                        <p class="lead">
                            Automated Production/Quality systems have weathered many technical &amp; cultural storms since the 
                            introduction of the personal computer (PC) and the subsequent proliferation of many application 
                            software programs. These applications covered the gamut including but not limited to: 
                            Supplier Management &amp; Control, Production Management &amp; MRP/ERP, Job Scheduling &amp; Inventory 
                            Control, Process Control, Statistical Process Control, Document Control, Customer Relationship 
                            Management, Complaint Tracking &amp; CAPA Management, Compliance Management/Auditing, Tool &amp; Gage 
                            Management, Preventative Maintenance, and Accounting/Billing/General Ledger.  The result yielded 
                            hundreds of vendors offering these applications. Eventually, end-user companies found themselves 
                            with a multitude of the above "point solutions" - each one purchased from a different vendor. 
                            Each program had its own learning curve. Some software vendors provided a menu of the above 
                            modules, yet still used a unique user interface and architecture in each product offering. 
                            (In some of these cases the software code was purchased from other failing software companies.)  
                            Finally, "integration" was accomplished by importing &amp; exporting spreadsheet-compatible files 
                            between software programs or by double &amp; triple entry of data/information across programs. 
                            The thought of this tangled web above is mind-boggling to say the least.

                            Still today, there are over 75 systems/software firms that offer the entire gamut or some 
                            subset of the applications above. Moreover, many of these firms are <u><strong>"hidden"</strong></u> in the market, 
                            (they do little mass advertising) yet offer excellent products. Furthermore, some firms offer 
                            a unique architecture/platform tailored toward specific needs, applications, and market segments.

                        <h2>Who are we and where are we coming from?</h2>
                        <p class="lead">
                            The key principal has spent 40 years in the "Production/Quality" discipline as both a 
                            vendor of systems and an end-user. On the vendor side, he worked for four (4) 
                            Production/Quality Systems vendors in sales, support, and training &amp; implementation 
                            roles. As an end-user, he worked for various companies as Quality Director, Quality Manager, 
                            and Internal Auditor. His experiences have also resulted in published articles in several trade 
                            journals. The services offered include interviews with key principals, use of extensive 
                            market research, customer surveys, and customer feedback. Several automated algorithms are also 
                            used to extract &amp; match specific user needs with software functionality. There are other 
                            websites/companies that offer a similar free service. However, their focus is spread-out over 
                            hundreds of disciplines and functional areas - Accounting, Project Planning/Estimating, Call 
                            Center, Construction, Legal Services, HR Services, Fleet Management, etc. Within a 
                            5-or-10-minute phone call, they can recommend a software program to buy. Our focus is strictly 
                            in the "Production/Quality" niche. We will spend more than 5 or 10 minutes with our detailed needs 
                            assessment, but our goal is to produce the perfect fit for your application.

                        <h2>Some Common Observations &amp; Myths</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The more features/functions, the better the product. 
                                Many sales folks will tell you their system will do everything from "A to Z". 
                                That's nice except you may only need "A thru E". The rest of the features are 
                                fine but will never be used.</li>
                            <li>Just because systems/software firms don't advertise in the major trade 
                                journals, doesn't mean they don't exist. Many firms don't see the need or 
                                the ROI for this promotional tactic. Our matrix consists of 75 systems/software 
                                firms - some of which are out-of-business! Yes, we list and monitor these firms 
                                because in many instances the source code &amp; intellectual property magically 
                                appears with another firm. This traceability is important especially when evaluating 
                                how the buying firm integrates the different technologies together.</li> 
                            <li>The software is user-friendly! All vendors say that. Well, we hope so! 
                                They wouldn't be in business if the software was difficult to use. 
                                We'll just toss this aside and maintain neutrality.</li>  
                            <li>The software firm was the "first" to market or the "only" firm to 
                                offer ______. After many years of analysis, it's difficult to put a 
                                date/time stamp on any "first" and we've seen multiple firms claim they 
                                are the "only" company to offer a specific function or calculation.</li> 
                            <li>This is a Free service. What's the catch? This is a matching service. 
                                If a sale is made, we will negotiate a sales commission or broker 
                                fee with the software vendor. The market research, customer surveys, and 
                                automated algorithms are sunk costs accrued over many years.</li>

                            and best of all - it's FREE AND TOTALLY CONFIDENTIAL! We'll email you a 
                            spreadsheet listing select functions/features. You simply rate &amp; weight each one 
                            using a numerical scale. Then, provide some additional information on your company 
                            and needs in the spreadsheet as well. Save the spreadsheet and email it back to us. 
                            We will then access our market research, customer surveys, customer testimonials and 
                            run several algorithms to extract significant matching data - your unique needs vs vendor 
                            capabilities. We may also have some phone / email exchanges with the software vendor and 
                            end-users to clarify any issues. Finally, we'll reply with the result - The perfect fit 
                            for your application. If this doesn't result in a marriage, don't worry there will be a 
                            few other vendors that grade out close to the first one. We can send them to you one at 
                            a time.  We do not consider the price of the software. There are companies that offer free 
                            pricing guides for various software products. Those pricing guides are obsolete the day 
                            they are created. Also, pricing models &amp; tactics change more often than the weather.</p>

                        <p class="lead">
                            In the first example, the client was a discrete part manufacturer in 
                            the automotive &amp; steel industries. Their primary need was for a 
                            Production-based management system, with real-time SPC integration. Other 
                            needs included Document Control, Tool &amp; Gauge Management, and Preventative 
                            Maintenance. They did not rate Supplier Management and Compliance Management, 
                            which may mean they had systems in place for those functions. Vendor "CN1" 
                            scored as the best match for this client with several others close behind. 
                            Keep in mind, other discrete part manufacturers in the automotive &amp; steel 
                            industry could get quite different results depending upon their "specific" needs.

                            In the next example, the client's functionality was process oriented as 
                            opposed to discrete part with an emphasis in chemicals and liquids with FDA 
                            regulations.  Their primary need was for a Process/SCADA-based management 
                            system, with real-time SPC integration. Other needs included Supplier 
                            Management, CRM and Compliance management. They did not rate Document Control, 
                            Tool &amp; Gauge Management, or Preventative Maintenance as primary needs. 
                            Vendor "CJ1" was the best fit with Vendor "F1" close behind.

                            In the final example, this client's functionality was focused more on ad-hoc 
                            desktop analytical needs rather than online functions on the production floor. 
                            These include Document Control, CRM &amp; Complaint Tracking, CAPA Management, Compliance 
                            Management, Auditing Management, and Environmental Health &amp; Safety (EH&S). 
                            Several Vendors scored well with Vendor "CD1" coming out on top as the 
                            perfect fit for this client.
