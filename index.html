                            our service will match your specific needs with a matrix of over 75 Production / Quality systems on the market 
                            including Production-based, SCADA-based, and desktop analytical software programs.

                        <h2>Some Background</h2>
                        <p class="lead">
                            Automated Production/Quality systems have weathered many technical &amp; cultural storms since the
                            introduction of the personal computer (PC) and the subsequent proliferation of many application
                            software programs. These applications covered the gamut including but not limited to: Supplier
                            Management &amp; Control, Production Management &amp; MRP/ERP, Job Scheduling &amp; Inventory Control,
                            Process Control, Statistical Process Control, Document Control, Customer Relationship Management,
                            Complaint Tracking &amp; CAPA Management, Compliance Management/Auditing, Tool &amp; Gage
                            Management, Preventative Maintenance, and Accounting/Billing/General Ledger. The result yielded
                            hundreds of vendors offering these applications. Eventually, end-user companies found themselves with
                            a multitude of the above "point solutions" - each one purchased from a different vendor. Each program
                            had its own learning curve. Some software vendors provided a menu of the above modules, yet still
                            used a unique user interface and architecture in each product offering. (In some of these cases the
                            software code was purchased from other failing software companies.) Finally, "integration" was
                            accomplished by importing &amp; exporting spreadsheet-compatible files between software programs or by
                            double &amp; triple entry of data/information across programs. The thought of this tangled web above is
                            mind-boggling to say the least.
                            Still today, there are over 75 systems/software firms that offer the entire gamut or some subset of the
                            applications above. Moreover, many of these firms are <strong><u>"hidden"</u></strong> in the market, (they do little mass
                            advertising) yet offer excellent products. Furthermore, some firms offer a unique architecture/platform
                            tailored toward specific needs, applications, and market segments.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Who are we and where are we coming from?</h2>
                        <p class="lead">
                            The key principal has spent 40 years in the "Production/Quality" discipline as both a vendor of systems
                            and an end-user. On the vendor side, he worked for four (4) Production/Quality Systems vendors in
                            sales, support, and training &amp; implementation roles. As an end-user, he worked for various companies as
                            Quality Director, Quality Manager, and Internal Auditor. His experiences have also resulted in published
                            articles in several trade journals. The services offered include interviews with key principals, use of
                            extensive market research, customer surveys, and customer feedback. Several automated algorithms
                            are also used to extract &amp; match specific user needs with software functionality. There are other
                            websites/companies that offer a similar free service. However, their focus is spread-out over hundreds
                            of disciplines and functional areas - Accounting, Project Planning/Estimating, Call Center, Construction,
                            Legal Services, HR Services, Fleet Management, etc. Within a 5-or-10-minute phone call, they can
                            recommend a software program to buy. Our focus is strictly in the "Production/Quality" niche. We will
                            spend more than 5 or 10 minutes with our detailed needs assessment, but our goal is to produce the
                            perfect fit for your application.

                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                The more features/functions, the better the product. Many sales folks will tell you their system
                                will do everything from "A to Z". That's nice except you may only need "A thru E". The rest of the
                                features are fine but will never be used.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Just because systems/software firms don't advertise in the major trade journals, doesn't mean
                                they don't exist. Many firms don't see the need or the ROI for this promotional tactic. Our
                                matrix consists of 75 systems/software firms - some of which are out-of-business! Yes, we list
                                and monitor these firms because in many instances the source code &amp; intellectual property
                                magically appears with another firm. This traceability is important especially when evaluating
                                how the buying firm integrates the different technologies together.
                            </li>

                                The software is user-friendly! All vendors say that. Well, we hope so! They wouldn't be in
                                business if the software was difficult to use. We'll just toss this aside and maintain neutrality.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The software firm was the "first" to market or the "only" firm to offer………..After many years of
                                analysis, it's difficult to put a date/time stamp on any "first" and we've seen multiple firms claim
                                they are the "only" company to offer a specific function or calculation.
                            </li>

                                This is a Free service. What's the catch? This is a matching service. If a sale is made, we will
                                negotiate a sales commission or broker fee with the software vendor. The market research,
                                customer surveys, and automated algorithms are sunk costs accrued over many years.

                        CONFIDENTIAL! We'll email you a spreadsheet listing select functions/features. You simply rate &amp; weight each
                        one using a numerical scale. Then, provide some additional information on your company and needs in the
                        spreadsheet as well. Save the spreadsheet and email it back to us. We will then access our market research,
                        customer surveys, customer testimonials and run several algorithms to extract significant matching data - your
                        unique needs vs vendor capabilities. Finally, we'll reply with the result - The perfect fit for your application. If
                        this doesn't result in a marriage, don't worry there will be a few other vendors that grade out close to the first
                        one. We can send them to you one at a time. We do not consider the price of the software. There are
                        companies that offer free pricing guides for various software products. Those pricing guides are obsolete the day

                        <h4>Discrete Part / Automotive &amp; Steel</h4>
                        <p class="lead">
                            In the first example, the client was a discrete part manufacturer in the automotive
                            &amp; steel industries. Their primary need was for a Production-based management
                            system, with real-time SPC integration. Other needs included Document Control,
                            Tool &amp; Gauge Management, and Preventative Maintenance. They did not rate
                            Supplier Management and Compliance Management which may mean they had
                            systems in place for those functions. Vendor "CN1" scored as the best match for
                            this client with several others close behind. Keep in mind, other discrete part
                            manufacturers in the automotive &amp; steel industry could get quite different results
                            depending upon their "specific" needs.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Process/SCADA-based / Chemicals / FDA Regulations</h4>
                        <p class="lead">
                            In the next example, the client's functionality was process oriented as opposed to
                            discrete part with an emphasis in chemicals and liquids with FDA regulations.
                            Their primary need was for a Process/SCADA-based management system, with
                            real-time SPC integration. Other needs included Supplier Management, CRM and
                            Compliance management. They did not rate Document Control, Tool &amp; Gauge
                            Management, or Preventative Maintenance as primary needs. Vendors "CJ1" and
                            "F1" scored well for this client. See the chart below.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Ad-hoc / Desktop Analytical</h4>
                        <p class="lead">
                            In the final example, this client's functionality was focused more on ad-hoc
                            desktop analytical needs rather than online functions on the production floor.
